**Design Philosophy:**- "Brutal Sophistication"The interface relies on a high-contrast palette and layered depth. It utilizes the "Brutal" side of modern UI (thick borders, heavy weights, uppercase labels) tempered by "Sophisticated" elements (glassmorphism, cinematic imagery, and smooth GSAP transitions).

**Typography Hierarchy** -The Inter font family is the backbone of the OS. The rule is to vary weight and letter-spacing rather than just size.ElementWeightCaseLetter SpacingNotesPrimary Heading900 (Black)SentenceTighter (-0.05em)"Welcome back." / "The Journey."Secondary Heading900 (Black)UppercaseTightSection titles like "PHASE ONE"Micro-Labels900 (Black)UppercaseWide (0.2em - 0.5em)"STAGE 01" / "MILESTONE PROGRESS"Body Text500 (Medium)SentenceNormalDescriptions and secondary info

**Color Palette & Surface** - uses a Surface-to-Subject depth model.Background (Surface 0): #FAFAFA (Off-white).Containers (Surface 1): #FFFFFF (Pure white) with 1px border #F3F4F6 (Gray-100).Action Surfaces: #000000 (Pure black) for primary CTAs and active states.Accents:Primary Blue: #2563EB (Blue-600) for strategic highlights and "Active" status.Success Green: #22C55E (Green-500) for completed milestones.Subtle Text: #9CA3AF (Gray-400) for labels.

**Component Standards** - The Journey Card (3D Interaction)Cards must follow the [Perspective: 1000px] rule to allow for the 180-degree flip.Front: Use a cinematic Unsplash image with a grayscale opacity-40 filter for unstarted items and a bg-gradient-to-t from-black overlay for text readability.Back: Deep Zinc/Black background (bg-gray-950). Deliverables are nested in bg-white/5 with 1px borders to create a "glass" inventory feel.Navigation & SidebarSidebar: Fixed 72w (w-72). Use 20x20 Lucide icons. Active state must be a solid black pill with white text/icon and a large shadow.Top Nav: 80px height (h-20). Must use backdrop-blur-md and bg-white/80 to imply transparency and depth as content scrolls beneath it.

**Animation & Motion (GSAP/Tailwind)**- Animations are used to signpost "Enterprise Performance."Entrance: Use animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-bottom-4 with a duration of 1000ms.Pulse: Use animate-pulse on small status indicators (like the logo dot) to indicate "Live" system status.Hover States: Images inside cards should use group-hover:scale-110 with a long duration (duration-[4000ms]) to create a "Ken Burns" cinematic effect.Transition: All interactive elements (buttons, sidebar items) must have transition-all duration-300.

**IconographyLibrary:** - Lucide-React.Sizing: * Standard UI: size={20}.Micro-indicators: size={14}.Hero/Header: size={24}.Styling: Icons in labels should be paired with tracking-widest uppercase text.7. Global Layout RulesBorder Radius: Use rounded-3xl (24px) for cards and rounded-2xl (16px) for inner components like buttons and file items.Shadows: Use shadow-2xl for the main dashboard hero and shadow-sm for standard journey cards.Spacing: Follow a base-4 system, but favor generous padding (p-12) for high-end "Editorial" feel.
