# Product Mission

## Pitch
Drift Nimbus Dashboard is a hosting management interface that helps existing Drift Nimbus customers simplify their hosting operations by providing an intuitive, centralized command center for cPanel functions, support, and billing.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Existing Hosting Clients**: Small to medium business owners or developers who use Drift Nimbus for their web hosting.

### User Personas
**Business Owner** (25-50)
- **Role:** Non-technical founder or manager.
- **Context:** Needs to manage business emails and hosting without navigating complex technical interfaces.
- **Pain Points:** cPanel can be overwhelming; Managing multiple services (hosting, billing, support) in different places.
- **Goals:** Quickly add email accounts, check site status, and pay invoices from one place.

## The Problem

### cPanel Complexity
Standard hosting control panels are often too technical for the average user, leading to confusion and increased support requests for basic tasks like password resets or email creation.

**Our Solution:** A custom-built, simplified visual interface that exposes only the most critical functions in a user-friendly "Bento" style dashboard.

## Differentiators

### Unified Command Center
Unlike generic hosting providers who send users to cPanel, we provide a unified dashboard that integrates hosting, billing (Zoho), and support (Trello).
